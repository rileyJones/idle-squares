# IdleSquares
## Goal
The goal is to get a higher score.
The player accomplishes this by touching the orange rectangle.
Doing so will increase the clicks counter.
Additionally, clicking the orange square repeatedly in a short time will increase the combo counter.
Every frame, the score is incremented by a function of the clicks and the combo.
## Features
Rotation: Rotating the screen will keep the score, and allow a different view.

Multiple Session Support: Score and clicks are auto-saved between sessions, allowing you to close the app.

Closed Play: Score is recalculated whenever the app is reopened based on the amount of time the app was closed.
